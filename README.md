# Anime Preference Classification - Python Validation

This repository contains Python scripts developed to cross-validate and compare the machine learning model results obtained from the main project, which was primarily conducted using **Orange Data Mining** software.

## Objective
The primary goal of this code is to verify the model accuracy and performance metrics. By replicating the classification models using the `scikit-learn` library, this validation process ensures the consistency and reliability of the findings derived from the Orange platform.

## Models Tested
The following algorithms were implemented to benchmark against the Orange results:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Naive Bayes (Best Performance in Python: ~39%)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Note
* **Validation Only:** This source code serves solely as a supplementary validation tool for the main project.
* **Full Analysis:** The comprehensive analysis, data interpretation, business insights, and final conclusions are documented in the full project report/presentation.
